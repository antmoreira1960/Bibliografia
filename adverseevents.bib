  abstract               = {Acupuncture is a well-known form of complementary medicine that is increasingly being used worldwide. Despite being rare, pneumothorax is the most common serious complication described in acupuncture. A 79-year-old woman was admitted to the emergency department with a pneumothorax. Two days before, she had undergone an acupuncture treatment for chronic back pain. She felt a sharp right shoulder pain as needles were inserted in the interscapular area. As the pain did not resolve, she consulted her general practitioner and had a chest radiography done, revealing a right-sided pneumothorax. At the hospital, a right chest tube was inserted with relief of the symptoms and lung expansion. The chest tube was removed on the second day of admission, and she was discharged on the third day. Both acupuncturists and clinicians need to be aware of the possibility of adverse events following acupuncture, especially in those who develop symptoms.},

This was following a history of acupuncture and cupping treatment an hour earlier at a traditional practitioner for long-standing neck pain. On physical examination, the respiratory rate was 22 breaths per minute and her oxygen saturation was 100% on room air. Breath sounds were decreased on the right hemithorax with hyper resonance to percussion. Inspection of her back revealed multiple needling and cupping marks. A chest radiograph revealed a right-sided pneumothorax with an apex-cupola distance of 3.6 cm. She was put on high flow oxygen and a chest tube was inserted into the right chest wall. The patient was admitted. She had radiographic resolution of the pneumothorax four days later and was discharged uneventfully. Follow-up one week later in the clinic showed no radiographic recurrence of the pneumothorax.},

  abstract           = {RATIONALE: Acupuncture, a component of traditional Chinese medicine, is also a well-known form of complementary and alternative medicine. Serious adverse events of acupuncture have been reported, including the acupuncture-related pneumothorax which is a rare but fatal condition sometimes. The pneumothorax was related to needle insertion in the upper back or paraspinal area and the reported victims suffered from either unilateral or bilateral pneumothorax. Postmortem computed tomography has advantages in the detection of pathologic gas and is being considered as a useful visualization tool for diagnosing the cause of death. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 52-year-old man underwent acupuncture and cupping treatment at an illegal Chinese medicine clinic for neck and back discomfort and was admitted to the hospital with severe gasp and dyspnea about 30 hours later. The patient suddenly became unconscious with heart rate and blood pressure lost and died after cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Diagnosis, interventions and outcomes: Whole-body postmortem computed tomography of the victim revealed collapse of the both lungs and mediastinal compression, which was also confirmed by autopsy. More than 20 pinprick injuries were found on the skin of the upper and lower back in which multiple pinpricks were located on the body surface projection of the lungs. The cause of death was concluded as acute respiratory and circulatory failure due to acupuncture-induced bilateral tension pneumothorax. LESSONS: Acupuncture-induced tension pneumothorax is rare and should be recognized by forensic pathologists. Postmortem computed tomography can be used to detect and accurately evaluate the severity of pneumothorax before autopsy and can play a supporting role in determining the cause of death.},

This study used ultrasonography (US) to measure the depth of the GB 21 acupoint in adults and assessed its applicability for ensuring safe acupuncture practices. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A US probe was used to measure the vertical depth from the skin to the pleural line of the apex of the lungs at the right and left GB 21 acupoints. The sex, age, body weight, height, and body mass index of each person were recorded. Student t test and generalized estimating equations were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Sixty women and 41 men with a median age of 29 years were included in this study. The depth of GB 21 increased with body weight, height, and body mass index (p < 0.001). The mean depth of GB 21 in men (17.4 mm) was greater than that in women (14.6 mm; p < 0.001). The depth difference between the right and left shoulders was significant in men (p < 0.001) but not in women. CONCLUSIONS: US can be used to measure GB 21 acupoint depth. Further control studies on its use to ensure safe clinical practices, including preventing acupuncture-related pneumothorax, are warranted.},

Many serious adverse events have been reported which include a spectrum of mild-to-fatal complications. However, the level of awareness with regard to complications is still low both to physicians and patients. We report a 63-year-old who presented with acute shortness of breath 2 hours after having had acupuncture. On examination, there was absent breath sound heard on the left lung and slightly reduced breath sound on the right lung. She had type 1 respiratory failure. Urgent chest radiograph confirmed bilateral pneumothorax which was more severe on the left with tension pneumothorax and mediastinal shift. Chest tubes were inserted bilaterally after failed needle aspiration attempts. Subsequently, the pneumothoraces resolved, and she was discharged well. The bilateral pneumothoraces caused by acupuncture were curable but could have been potentially fatal if diagnosis was delayed. This case report adds to the limited current literature on the complications of acupuncture leading to bilateral pneumothoraces.},

  abstract           = {BACKGROUND: Chronic pelvic inflammation disease (PID) is a difficult-to-treat gynecological disorder with complex etiologies. Acupuncture has been applied widely for treating chronic pelvic inflammation or chronic pelvic pain symptoms in China. The aim of this review is to undertake a systematic review to estimate the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture on chronic PID. METHODS: A literature search will be conducted electronically with date up to October 2018 in MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, EBASE, and CNKI databases, using combination subject terms of chronic pelvic pain (or chronic pelvic inflammation, and chronic pelvic pain symptoms, etc.) and acupuncture related treatment. Also duplicates will be removed. The primary outcomes consisted of improvement rate and pain relief. Secondary outcomes include the recurrence rate and side effects, such as pneumothorax, bleeding, serious discomfort, subcutaneous nodules, and infection. Systematic reviews and databases will be searched for randomized controlled trials on acupuncture for chronic PID with acupuncture treatment will be included. Cochrane RevMan V5.3.5 risk of bias assessment tool will be implemented for risk of bias evaluation, data synthesis, meta-analyses, and subgroup analysis while condition is met. Mean difference (MD), standard mean difference (SMD), and dichotomous data will be used to present continuous outcomes. RESULTS: This study will generate a comprehensive review of current evidence of acupuncture for chronic pelvic inflammation diseases. CONCLUSION: The study will provide updated evidence to evaluate the effectiveness and side effects of acupuncture for chronic pelvic inflammation disease.

However, adverse effects can occur, including trauma, pneumothorax, and central-nervous-system injury. Our objective was to develop a reliable and practical procedure for ultrasound imaging of acupuncture points to improve safety during needling, and to acquire ultrasound images of several (44) acupuncture points, especially those in high-risk areas, according to an in-house standard operating procedure. Methods: We created the standard operating procedure for ultrasound imaging for acupuncture, and collected ultrasound images of acupuncture points in clinical trials. Results: Ultrasound images for 44 acupuncture points considered as high-risk points were collected from 85 healthy people who were classified by body-mass index, and high-quality, clear representative images of all 44 points were obtained. Conclusion: These baseline images could be helpful for understanding the anatomy under the skin at acupuncture points, which would allow for an enhanced safety and more accurate needling.},

Although it is known as a safe procedure, complications including infection, pneumothorax, hemorrhage, and cardiac tamponade have been reported. The authors present a rare case of fatal acute peritonitis due to penetration of acupuncture needles directly into the abdominal and pelvic cavity. The victim was a 55-year-old woman who had a recent history of chemo-radiotherapy due to breast cancer. She was collapsed three days after receiving acupuncture. She had symptoms of fever and chilling sensation, general myalgia, and vomiting during three days. The autopsy revealed several needle marks in the lower abdomen and 180ml of bloody exudate in the abdominal cavity. There was no visible intestinal perforation, but hemorrhagic foci in the mesentery and paracolic area of sigmoid colon were noted. The deepest portion was 13.5cm from the needle marks on the abdominal skin. The practitioner had not a Chinese medical license. He was accused of illegal medical practice and manslaughter. Acute peritonitis associated with acupuncture might be caused by inadequate sterilization of skin and needle itself and/or direct mesentery injury.},

Setting: At the emergency department of a tertiary hospital in an urban area during a five-year period (2010-2014) in Seoul, Korea. Subjects: Patients with postacupuncture mechanical complications in the thoracoabdominal region. Methods: All cases were independently assessed for inclusion by two emergency physicians based on the causal relationship between acupuncture and emergency department presentation. Results: There were 10 cases of pneumothorax (one combined with pneumomediastinum) and two cases of pneumoperitoneum induced by acupuncture. Five of the 12 patients were male; the mean age was 43.4 years. The mean time between acupuncture and emergency department admission was 1.6 days. The pneumothorax was unilateral in eight cases and bilateral in two. Eight patients underwent tube thoracostomy (pig tail catheter or chest tube insertion) and were admitted to the hospital for a median of 11 days. Of the two patients with pneumoperitoneum, one was transferred to another hospital for emergency surgery and the other was admitted to our hospital after emergency total colectomy. Conclusions: Life-threating complications such as pneumothorax and bowel perforation after acupuncture can occur, and this suggests that physicians, especially acupuncturists, should be aware of the risk associated with needling around the trunk region. To maximize the safety of acupuncture, adequate competency-based training should be provided.},

Status reports (nurse records in ambulatory and inpatient care units, and administrative event records) as a part of an internal audit at a Korean Medicine hospital specializing in the treatment of musculoskeletal disorders, patient complaints filed through the hospital website, and medical records of patients visiting from December, 2010 (inception of internal audit) to October, 2014 were retrospectively reviewed. A total 80,523 patients (5966 inpatients and 74,557 outpatients) visited during this period. Inpatients received an average 31.9 +/- 20.7 acupuncture, 23.0 +/- 15.6 pharmacopuncture, and 15.4 +/- 11.3 bee venom pharmacopuncture sessions, and outpatients were administered 8.2 +/- 12.2 acupuncture, 7.8 +/- 11.5 pharmacopuncture, and 10.0 +/- 12.3 bee venom sessions, respectively. AEs associated with acupuncture/pharmacopuncture were forgotten needle (n = 47), hypersensitivity to bee venom (n = 37), presyncopic episode (n = 4), pneumothorax (n = 4), and infection (n = 2). Most cases were mild requiring little or no additional intervention and leaving no sequelae. Although serious AEs including infection (n = 2) and anaphylaxis associated with bee venom treatment (n = 3) were also reported, incidence was rare at 0.002% in infection and 0.019% in anaphylaxis. Incidence of AEs associated with acupuncture/pharmacopuncture treatment was low, and most cases were not serious. Still, however rare, avoidable AEs can and should be prevented through education and corrective action. Further prospective studies on the effect of error reduction strategies on incidence of adverse effects are warranted.},

  abstract           = {OBJECTIVES: Acupuncture is increasing in popularity as a complementary and alternative medicine. Pneumothorax is the most common and potentially serious adverse effect after acupuncture. This complication can cause fatality in the absence of rapid treatment. Here, we analyze the clinical presentation and discuss prevention of post-acupuncture pneumothorax and an approach to reducing this complication. METHODS: Patients presenting with post-acupuncture pneumothorax in our hospital center during 2011-2015 were retrospectively analyzed. Body mass index (BMI), patient's pre-acupuncture chief complaint and disease, and the characteristics associated with pneumothorax were assessed. The diagnosis of pneumothorax was based on clinical presentation and chest radiography. Conservative treatment or thoracostomy was performed. RESULTS: Seventeen patients (15 women and 2 men) with a mean age of 42 years (range: 18-73 years) were included; three were underweight (BMI < 18.5kg/m2), 11 patients had a healthy weight (BMI= 18.5-22.95kg/m2), one was overweight (BMI = 23- 24.95kg/m2), and two were obese (BMI >/= 25 kg/m2). All but one case of bilateral pneumothorax had unilateral pneumothorax (right side: 6; left side: 10). Chest pain or dyspnea, or both. were the initial symptoms in all patients. Twelve patients underwent immediate thoracostomy. The patient with bilateral pneumothorax underwent right-side thoracostomy, and subsequently left-side thoracostomy, due to progression of the left-side pneumothorax. Five patients were successfully managed conservatively. All patients had an excellent outcome; all were asymptomatic and exhibited a normal chest X-ray at follow-up. CONCLUSION: Acupuncturists must be aware that delayed diagnosis and management of pneumothorax are life-threatening, and when symptoms of possible pneumothorax arise, patients should be advised to undergo an appropriate evaluation and intervention, particularly so in those with abnormal BMI.},

All first-hand case reports of acupuncture-related complications and adverse events that could be identified in the scientific literature were reviewed and classified according to the type of complication and adverse event, circumstance of the event, and long-term patient outcome. The selected case reports were published between 1980 and 2013 in 3 databases. Relevant papers were collected and analyzed by 2 reviewers. Over the 33 years, 182 incidents were identified in 133 relevant papers. Internal organ, tissue, or nerve injury is the main complications of acupuncture especially for pneumothorax and central nervous system injury. Adverse effects also included syncope, infections, hemorrhage, allergy, burn, aphonia, hysteria, cough, thirst, fever, somnolence, and broken needles. Qualifying training of acupuncturists should be systemized and the clinical acupuncture operations should be standardized in order to effectively prevent the occurrence of acupuncture accidents, enhance the influence of acupuncture, and further popularize acupuncture to the rest of the world.},

  abstract               = {This paper reports a rare iatrogenic complication of acupuncture-induced haemothorax and comments on the importance and need for special education of physicians and physiotherapists in order to apply safe and effective acupuncture treatment. A 37-year-old healthy woman had a session of acupuncture treatments for neck and right upper thoracic non-specific musculoskeletal pain, after which she gradually developed dyspnoea and chest discomfort. After some delay while trying other treatment, she was eventually transferred to the emergency department where a chest X-ray revealed a right pneumothorax and fluid collection. She was admitted to hospital and a chest tube inserted into the right hemithorax (under ultrasound guidance) drained 800 mL of bloody fluid (haematocrit (Hct) 17.8%) in 24 h and 1200 mL over the following 3 days. Her blood Hct fell from 39.0% to 30.8% and haemoglobin from 12.7 to 10.3 g/dL. The patient recovered completely and was discharged after 9 days of hospitalisation. When dyspnoea, chest pain and discomfort occur during or after an acupuncture treatment, the possibility of secondary (traumatic) pneumo- or haemopneumothorax should be considered and the patient should remain under careful observation (watchful waiting) for at least 48 h. To maximise the safety of acupuncture, specific training should be given for the safe use of acupuncture points of the anterior and posterior thoracic wall using dry needling, trigger point acupuncture or other advanced acupuncture techniques.},

This complication was not considered as a differential diagnosis thus even worsening the patient's life-threatening condition.},

  abstract           = {Background: Acupuncture-related pneumothorax (PTX) is a poorly reported complication of thoracic needling. Recent Chinese literature reviews cited PTXs as the most common adverse outcome. Because of delayed presentation, this complication is thought to be underrecognized by acupuncturists and is largely addressed by hospital and emergency room personnel. The goal of this case study was to demonstrate common risk factors for a PTX, the mechanisms for its development, and protocols to use if one is suspected. Case: A 43-year-old, athletic female with chronic neck pain that was poorly managed with oral medications sought an alternative intervention for pain control. Her treatment plan consisted of weekly acupuncture sessions in the prone and supine positions targeting points along the Bladder, Gall Bladder, and Small Intestine meridians, as well as the right scapular Ah Shi point. She also received infrared lamp therapy. The aim of this approach was to help the patient achieve subjective pain reduction and increased range of motion. Results: One hour after her third treatment session, this patient experienced pleuritic chest pain and dyspnea. She was transported to a local Level-1 trauma center by emergency medical services and was diagnosed with a right-sided PTX. Conclusions: The acupoints addressed, a practitioner's knowledge of variations in anatomy, and a patient's body habitus and medical history are risk factors for PTX development. A patient's initial presentation does not predict future outcome. A benign presentation can evolve into a potentially life-threatening cardiovascular collapse. When PTX is suspected, discussing it with the patient and facilitating appropriate evaluation and intervention by a tertiary-care facility is warranted.},

  abstract               = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate adverse events attributed to traditional medical treatments in the Republic of Korea. METHODS: Adverse events recorded in the Republic of Korea between 1999 and 2010 - by the Food and Drug Administration, the Consumer Agency or the Association of Traditional Korean Medicine - were reviewed. Records of adverse events attributed to the use of traditional medical practices, including reports of medicinal accidents and consumers' complaints, were investigated. FINDINGS: Overall, 9624 records of adverse events attributed to traditional medical practices - including 522 linked to herbal treatments - were identified. Liver problems were the most frequently reported adverse events. Only eight of the adverse events were recorded by the pharmacovigilance system run by the Food and Drug Administration. Of the 9624 events, 1389 - mostly infections, cases of pneumothorax and burns - were linked to physical therapy (n = 285) or acupuncture/moxibustion (n = 1104). CONCLUSION: In the Republic of Korea, traditional medical practices often appear to have adverse effects, yet almost all of the adverse events attributed to such practices between 1999 and 2010 were missed by the national pharmacovigilance system. The Consumer Agency and the Association of Traditional Korean Medicine should be included in the national pharmacovigilance system.},

In this commentary, the article is reviewed and issues are highlighted about how to interpret and contextualize the results of their study. While their review has been well performed, certain areas have been identified where the results may be inaccurate due to problems in the reporting of original incidents. For example, potential problems were found in the reporting of the minor adverse event (AE) of fainting and the more serious AEs of pneumothorax and hepatitis. The article by He and colleagues highlights the issue that almost all AEs associated with acupuncture in the modern period are due to the administration of the therapy rather than the therapy itself. Future prospective studies can address some of the shortcomings identified in this review.},

A 69-year-old large-bodied man, who otherwise had no risk factors for spontaneous pneumothorax, presented with chest pressure, cold sweats and shortness of breath. Immediately after bilateral pneumothorax had been identified on a chest radiograph in the emergency room, his blood pressure and percutaneous oxygen saturation suddenly decreased to 78 mm Hg and 86%, respectively. We confirmed deterioration in his cardiopulmonary status and diagnosed bilateral tension pneumothorax. We punctured his chest bilaterally and inserted chest tubes for drainage. His vital signs promptly recovered. After the bilateral puncture and drainage, we learnt that he had been treated with acupuncture on his upper back. We finally diagnosed a bilateral tension pneumothorax based on the symptoms that appeared 8 h after the acupuncture. Because the patient had no risk factors for spontaneous pneumothorax, no alternative diagnosis was proposed. We recommend that patients receiving acupuncture around the chest wall must be adequately informed of the possibility of complications and expected symptoms, as a definitive diagnosis can be difficult without complete information.},

He was observed in an emergency room for 24 hours while being treated with oxygen, a painkiller, antibiotics, and bedrest. A follow-up computed tomography scan of his chest 1 week later showed complete resolution of the pneumothorax. CASE ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION: Details of the case are analyzed. A general review of the incidence, causes, symptoms, and outcomes of acupuncture induced pneumothorax is presented. In addition, improved needling methods including needling depth and angle, together with corresponding precautions are also discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Pneumothorax caused by acupuncture therapy uncommon, but the consequences can be serious. It is important for practitioners to have adequate knowledge so they can implement better prevention of acupuncture-induced pneumothorax.},

METHODS: Four (4) major Chinese comprehensive databases were searched: Chinese Journal Full-text Database (1949-2010), China Biomedical Literature Database (1978-2010), Chinese Technology Journal Database (1989-2010), and Wanfang (1998-2010). Case reports of adverse events related to acupuncture therapy were included. Literature reviews, case-control study, translations, duplicate literatures in various databases, and duplicate published articles with duplicate data were excluded. RESULTS: One hundred and sixty-seven (167) articles were included with 1038 cases, among which 35 patients died. The most frequent adverse events were syncope (468 cases), pneumothorax (307 cases), and subarachnoid hemorrhage (64 cases). CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture-related adverse events were mainly caused by mental tension of the patient, improper operation by the doctor, and incompleteness of sterilization. Most of them can be avoided by standardizing teaching and clinical practices. Making the corresponding safety standards can greatly lower the risk of adverse events and protect patient safety to the greatest extent.},

  abstract           = {BACKGROUND: Acupuncture is frequently employed to treat chronic pain syndromes or other chronic conditions. Nevertheless, there is a growing literature on adverse events (AEs) from treatments including pneumothorax, cardiac tamponade and spinal cord injury. Acupuncture is provided in almost all NHS pain clinics and by an increasing number of GP's and physiotherapists. Considering acupuncture's popularity, its safety has become an important public health issue. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the harm caused to patients through acupuncture treatments within NHS organisations. METHODS: The National Reporting and Learning System (NRLS) database was searched for incidents reported from 1st January 2009 to 31st December 2011. The free text fields of all reports received from all healthcare settings and specialties were searched for the keyword 'acupuncture'. All relevant incidents were reviewed to provide a qualitative theme of the harm to patients. RESULTS: 468 patient safety incidents were identified; 325 met our inclusion criteria for analysis. Adverse events reported include retained needles (31%), dizziness (30%), loss of consciousness/unresponsive (19%), falls (4%), Bruising or soreness at needle site (2%), Pneumothorax (1%) and other adverse reactions (12%). The majority (95%) of the incidents were categorised as low or no harm. CONCLUSIONS: A number of AEs are recorded after acupuncture treatments in the NHS but the majority is not severe. However, miscategorisation and under-reporting may distort the overall picture. Acupuncture practitioners should be aware of, and be prepared to manage, any significant harm from treatments.},

  abstract               = {CONTEXT: Acupuncture is increasingly used in children; however, the safety of pediatric acupuncture has yet to be reported from systematic review. OBJECTIVE: To identify adverse events (AEs) associated with needle acupuncture in children. METHODS: Eighteen databases were searched, from inception to September 2010, irrespective of language. Inclusion criteria were that the study (1) was original peer-reviewed research, (2) included children from birth to 17 years, inclusively, (3) involved needle acupuncture, and (4) included assessment of AEs in a child. Safety data were extracted from all included studies. RESULTS: Of 9537 references identified, 450 were assessed for inclusion. Twenty-eight reports were included, and searches of reference lists identified 9 additional reports (total: 37). A total of 279 AEs were identified, 146 from randomized controlled trials, 95 from cohort studies, and 38 from case reports/series. Of the AEs, 25 were serious (12 cases of thumb deformity, 5 infections, and 1 case each of cardiac rupture, pneumothorax, nerve impairment, subarachnoid hemorrhage, intestinal obstruction, hemoptysis, reversible coma, and overnight hospitalization), 1 was moderate (infection), and 253 were mild. The mild AEs included pain, bruising, bleeding, and worsening of symptoms. We calculated a mild AE incidence per patient of 168 in 1422 patients (11.8% [95% confidence interval: 10.1-13.5]). CONCLUSIONS: Of the AEs associated with pediatric needle acupuncture, a majority of them were mild in severity. Many of the serious AEs might have been caused by substandard practice. Our results support those from adult studies, which have found that acupuncture is safe when performed by appropriately trained practitioners.},

Chest tube drainage resulted in complete lung expansion, and analysis of the milky fluid revealed chyle leakage.

Acupuncture-induced thoracic duct injury, although extremely rare, should be considered as a cause of chylothorax.},

This review was aimed at critically evaluating systematic reviews of acupuncture as a treatment of pain and at summarizing reports of serious adverse effects published since 2000. Literature searches were carried out in 11 databases without language restrictions. Systematic reviews were considered for the evaluation of effectiveness and case series or case reports for summarizing adverse events. Data were extracted according to predefined criteria. Fifty-seven systematic reviews met the inclusion criteria. Four were of excellent methodological quality. Numerous contradictions and caveats emerged. Unanimously positive conclusions from more than one high-quality systematic review existed only for neck pain. Ninety-five cases of severe adverse effects including 5 fatalities were included. Pneumothorax and infections were the most frequently reported adverse effects. In conclusion, numerous systematic reviews have generated little truly convincing evidence that acupuncture is effective in reducing pain. Serious adverse effects continue to be reported. Numerous reviews have produced little convincing evidence that acupuncture is effective in reducing pain. Serious adverse events, including deaths, continue to be reported.},

  abstract               = {OBJECTIVE: to systematically review the Chinese-language literature on acupuncture-related adverse events. METHODS: we searched three Chinese databases (the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, 1980-2009; the Chinese Journal Full-Text Database, 1980-2009; and the Weipu Journal Database, 1989-2009) to identify Chinese-language articles about the safety of traditional needle acupuncture. Case reports, case series, surveys and other observational studies were included if they reported factual data, but review articles, translations and clinical trials were excluded. FINDINGS: the inclusion criteria were met by 115 articles (98 case reports and 17 case series) that in total reported on 479 cases of adverse events after acupuncture. Fourteen patients died. Acupuncture-related adverse events were classified into three categories: traumatic, infectious and "other". The most frequent adverse events were pneumothorax, fainting, subarachnoid haemorrhage and infection, while the most serious ones were cardiovascular injuries, subarachnoid haemorrhage, pneumothorax and recurrent cerebral haemorrhage. CONCLUSION: many acupuncture-related adverse events, most of them owing to improper technique, have been described in the published Chinese literature. Efforts should be made to find effective ways of monitoring and minimizing the risks related to acupuncture.},

  abstract               = {BACKGROUND: To evaluate the safety of acupuncture in a large number of patients receiving conventional health care and, based on these results, to develop a new medical consent form for acupuncture. METHODS: The prospective observational study included patients who received acupuncture treatment for chronic osteoarthritis pain of the knee or hip, low back pain, neck pain or headache, allergic rhinitis, asthma, or dysmenorrhoea. After treatment, all patients documented adverse events associated with acupuncture (defined as adverse effects). Patients who reported a need for treatment due to an adverse effect completed an additional standardised questionnaire on the most important adverse effect. Based on this data and considering ethical and legal aspects a new consent form was developed. RESULTS: A total of 229,230 patients received on average 10.2 +/- 3.0 acupuncture treatments. Altogether, 19,726 patients (8.6%) reported experiencing at least one adverse effect and 4,963 (2.2%) reported one which required treatment. Common adverse effects were bleedings or haematoma (6.1% of patients, 58% of all adverse effects), pain (1.7%) and vegetative symptoms (0.7%). Two patients experienced a pneumothorax (one needed hospital treatment, the other observation only). The longest duration of a side effect was 180 days (nerve lesion of the lower limb). The resulting medical consent form consists of five modules: Introduction to acupuncture and moxibustion, Risks of acupuncture treatment, Conditions which can increase the risk, Doctor's statement, and Consent. CONCLUSION: Acupuncture provided by physicians is a relatively safe treatment and the proposed consent form could support both patients and professionals in the process of obtaining informed consent.},

METHODS: Retrospectively analyze the clinical original symptoms of 38 cases with pneumothorax caused by acupuncture and acupoint injection, which were divided into four clinical types: dyspnea type, shock type, thoracalgia type and tardy type. Illustrate the relation of the clinical types with severe degrees of pneumothorax, and the mechanism of pneumothorax inducing death of the patient. RESULTS: In the series there were 38 cases with pneumothorax induced by acupuncture or acupoint injection, including 4 cases of dyspnea type, 16 cases of shock type, 14 cases of thoracalgia type, 4 cases of tardy type. After proper treatment, 37 cases were cured and one case of dyspnea type died of tension pneumothorax. CONCLUSION: The mechanism of pneumothorax caused by acupuncture or acupoint injection is that due to the filiform needle tip or the syringe's needle tip inserting into the lung tissue at the patient's respiration in acupuncture or acupoint injection, the filiform needle tip or the syringe's needle tip lacerates the lung tissue. Air in alveolus goes into the thorax pleura cavity to form pneumothorax. In acupuncture or acupoint injection, the needle tip must not insert into the lung tissue, which is a key for prevention of pneumothorax.},

  abstract           = {BACKGROUND: Acupuncture is currently the most popular of all forms of complementary and alternative medicine, and acupuncture is not dangerous in the hands of a trained practitioner. However, complications of acupuncture including pneumothorax have been reported. OBJECTIVES: Despite the use of fine needles in acupuncture, the lung-collapsed degree of acupuncture pneumothorax is relatively high. In general, the treatment modality of acupuncture pneumothorax is closed thoracostomy with a chest tube of larger diameter. However, the treatment of acupuncture pneumothorax frequently faces controversy concerning the necessity of a standard chest drain insertion. DESIGN: This was a retrospective study from March 1994 to February 2004. SUBJECTS: Nine (9) patients were admitted due to pneumothorax following acupuncture from March 1994 to February 2004 in Hanil General Hospital, KEPCO Medical Foundation (Seoul, Republic of Korea). RESULTS: Five (5) patients had a moderate degree of pneumothoraces, while 4 patients had a severe degree of pneumothoraces. Four (4) patients were treated by closed thoracostomy with a standard chest drain and the other four patients were treated by the percutaneous chest drainage with a narrow-bore central venous catheter. One (1) patient with a mild degree of pneumothorax was treated only by nasal oxygen inhalation. One (1) patient was treated by video-assisted thoracic surgery after the closed thoracostomy due to continuous air leak. CONCLUSIONS: We treated the acupuncture pneumothorax by making a choice between the closed thoracostomy and the percutaneous chest drainage based on a smoking history and chest radiographic findings. In the absence of smoking history and pulmonary emphysema or bullae, we got favorable results, not by the closed thoracostomy but only by the percutaneous chest drainage with a narrow-bore central venous catheter.},

Because of its rarity, there are few reports in literature and, therefore little information regarding clinical and therapeutic aspects. This article aims to analyze the clinical presentation, management and follow-up of patients with pneumothorax after acupuncture. METHODS: Retrospective study of patients with post-acupuncture pneumothorax evaluated in a tertiary hospital during a five-year period (2001-2006). RESULTS: Five patients (3 male and 2 female), mean age 46 years (30-73) were included. All patients but one (who had a bilateral pneumothorax) had left-sided pneumothorax . Chest pain, which was the initial symptom in all patients was severe in three cases and mild in two. Four patients underwent tube thoracostomy (pig-tail catheter), three of them immediately after admission and the other after a failed 12-hour conservative treatment period. One patient had a successful conservative management. All had an excellent outcome and were asymptomatic and exhibited a normal chest X-ray at 6-month follow-up CONCLUSION: In all patients, the initial symptom was chest pain, of varying intensity. Tube thoracostomy was the therapeutic modality most frequently employed. All patients had a successful outcome with no further complications.},

The patient received acupuncture treatment approximately 5 years prior to this presentation for treatment of posttraumatic chronic right shoulder pain. Chest radiography revealed retained needles in his right shoulder girdle and a needle overlying the thoracic cage with an attendant pneumothorax. Catheter aspiration for simple pneumothorax provided immediate symptomatic relief. Video-assisted thoracoscopy was then used to remove the migratory acupuncture needle from the chest wall. The patient recovered without complication and was discharged to home.},

  abstract           = {This is the fourth in a series of articles on the spine. The first reviewed the anatomy of the neck; the second reviewed the upper thoracic spine and chest (T1-T4); and the third reviewed the middle thoracic spine and chest (T5-T8). The procedures performed in the lower thoracic spine include percutaneous biopsies of the liver and kidneys, percutaneous nephrolithotomy, spinal injections, radiofrequency ablations, electromyography of the diaphragm, trigger point injections, chemodenervation with botulinum toxin, acupuncture, aneurysm repair, and, occasionally, chest tube placement in the lower lung fields. Complications include subcapsular hematomas, infections, pneumothorax, hemothorax, spinal cord ischemia and resultant paraplegia, and, rarely, nephropleural fistulas. This article provides anatomically accurate schematics of innervations of the lower thoracic chest and spine (T9-T12) that can be used to interpret the magnetic resonance images of the muscles and the nerves. Cross-sectional schematics of the lower thoracic chest and spine were drawn as they appear on imaging projections. The relevant nerves were color coded. The muscles and skin surfaces were labeled and assigned the color of the appropriate nerves. An organized comprehensive map of the motor innervation of the lower thoracic chest and spine allows the physician to increase the accuracy and the efficacy of interventional procedures. This could also assist the electromyographer in correlating the clinical and electrophysiological findings with magnetic resonance images.},

  abstract           = {OBJECTIVE: To summarise the range and frequency of significant adverse events associated with acupuncture in order to provide evidence on which to base continuing efforts to improve the safety of acupuncture practice. METHODS: Searches were conducted of computerised databases, previous reviews of case reports, population surveys, prospective surveys of acupuncture practice and relevant sections of textbooks for primary and secondary reports to indicate the range of significant adverse events associated with acupuncture. Data from prospective surveys of acupuncture were combined to estimate the incidence of serious adverse events. RESULTS: A total of 715 adverse events was included. There were 90 primary reports of trauma, and 186 secondary reports; the most common were pneumothorax and injury to the central nervous system. Infection accounted for 204 primary reports and 91 secondary reports. Over 60% of these cases were hepatitis B. The next most common infection was of the external ear, as a complication of auricular acupuncture. The 144 miscellaneous events mainly comprised seizures and drowsiness judged severe enough to cause a traffic hazard. There were 12 primary reports of deaths. According to the evidence from 12 prospective studies which surveyed more than a million treatments, the risk of a serious adverse event with acupuncture is estimated to be 0.05 per 10 000 treatments, and 0.55 per 10 000 individual patients. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of serious events occurring in association with acupuncture is very low, below that of many common medical treatments. The range of adverse events reported is wide and some events, specifically trauma and some episodes of infection, are likely to be avoidable.},

In this case, a slender woman received acupuncture from a fully trained medical acupuncturist including needling of the points LU1 in the subacromial region and BL13, which is a paravertebral point at the level of the spinous process of the third thoracic vertebra. During the final treatment, she experienced difficulties in breathing and pain in the left chest. On x ray examination a tension pneumothorax was diagnosed. Even though pneumothorax is the most frequently reported serious complication related to acupuncture, it is not an inevitable complication of acupuncture, and in most cases involves negligence from inadequate consideration of basic anatomy.},

Pneumothorax due to perforation of the lungs by needle insertion is one of the most common and serious complications of acupuncture treatment. Although there have been several case studies of pneumothorax induced by acupuncture, as far as we know there have been no reports on the pathological findings of autopsy cases. In this report, we describe the pathological findings of an autopsy case of bilateral tension pneumothorax after acupuncture. The patient suffered dyspnea and chest pain soon the completion of an acupuncture treatment, and died 90 min later. Several ecchymoses were macroscopically observed on the parietal pleura in the left and right thoracic cavity, suggesting that needles were inserted into the thoracic cavity and that the lungs were perforated. The many black spots we observed on the parietal pleura along the vertebral column microscopically consisted of a number of dust-like black pigments and macrophages containing these pigments. These spots seemed to have appeared because of the previous insertion of needles.},

We experienced a 56-yr-old male diabetic patient presenting with serious retroperitoneal abscess after acupuncture treatments. Emergency operative drainage with adequate antibiotic therapy was performed. Bacterial culture of blood and closed pus specimens recovered Klebsiella pneumoniae. In addition to application of better knowledge on anatomy, appropriate antiseptic practice by practitioners will reduce many serious complications associated with acupuncture.},

Mechanical injuries may be observed following acupuncture leading to pneumothorax, cardiac tamponade or spinal injury. Infectious complications after acupuncture include hepatitis and bacterial endocariditis. Organ toxicity has been observed associated with various herbal preparations involving the liver, kidneys, and the heart. Some herbs may have cancerogenic properties. Severe nutritional deficiencies can occur in infants and small children given strict alternative diets, resembling 'kwashiorkor'. Finally, among other miscellaneous adverse effects, adulteration with steroids, and herbal and drug interactions are discussed. The pattern of side-effects is similar to that observed by the use of conventional medicine. Therefore, caution may be justified using both conventional and unconventional methods. Only if the benefit is proven and the side-effects are established, should a given method be chosen.},

OBSERVATION: During a session of acupuncture, a 25-year-old woman had a malaise with shock and neurological disorders. The initial examinations revealed a bilateral pneumothorax associated with pericardial and peritoneal effusions. Symptomatic reanimation combining dopamine, left pleural draining and pericardial puncture led to rapid haemodynamic improvement. The etiological exploration, having eliminated an underlying pathology, concluded in the diagnosis of tamponade and bilateral pneumothorax following a session of acupuncture. COMMENTS: Our patient presented the association of two traumatic complications of acupuncture: cardiac tamponade due to haemopericardium and bilateral pneumothorax. Although these complications are rare, they must be known.},

Although recently performed prospective studies on the frequency of adverse effects of acupuncture found no severe complication, since 1965 many case reports of serious or even life-threatening incidents caused by acupuncture have appeared in the scientific literature. The most frequently reported complications are pneumothorax and lesions of the spinal cord. Severe injuries of peripheral nerves and blood vessels due to acupuncture seem to be very rare. Although case reports do not produce reliable data on the frequency of adverse events. information on sources of application errors can be extracted to increase the quality of acupuncture in education and therapy. All traumatic injuries described in this article could be avoided if practitioners had better anatomical knowledge, applied existing anatomical knowledge better, or both.},

Harmless disturbances are common and include minor bleedings or haematomas, pain during insertion or after withdrawal of the needle, and skin symptoms. In every second acupuncture treatment, at least one of these complications occurs. Orthostatic dysregulations are relatively rare and can be observed in only 1% of patients. They can be prevented by treating the patient in a lying position, especially in the first treatment session. Stab injuries of internal organs most often affect the lungs, resulting in a pneumothorax. At least 23 cases have been published, 2 of them with fatal consequences. An inquiry of Norwegian doctors even suggests that until 1995 in Norway alone 250 cases of pneumothorax after acupuncture occurred. Stab injuries of other internal organs or the CNS are only described in case reports, but some of them had fatal consequences. Stab injuries of peripheral nerves or large vessels and systemic bacterial infections like sepsis or endocarditis are very rare but serious consequences have been described. The transmission of viral infections due to insufficiently sterilised acupuncture needles loses more and more importance. The incidence of local infections can possibly be influenced, but even in Europe this complication still occurs frequently. The overview of published complications leads to the contraindications of acupuncture. Disturbances of coagulation, immune deficiency, abnormal heart valves or prosthetic valves are the most important ones to name. Suggestions for obtaining informed consent may be helpful while performing clinical trials.},

  abstract           = {CONTEXT: Many Japanese cases of adverse events after acupuncture are not listed in medical databases such as Medline. Therefore, they are not easily accessible to researchers outside Japan. OBJECTIVE: To complement existing reviews of adverse events after acupuncture in the West and to provide more detailed discussion and analysis. DATA SOURCES: Literature search using 'Igaku Chuo Zasshi (Japana Centra Revuo Medicina) CD-ROM version' covering the period of 1987-1999. STUDY SELECTION: Case reports of adverse events, which were suspected to be due to acupuncture treatment, were included. Experimental studies, surveys, and news articles were excluded. DATA EXTRACTION: Two independent reviewers extracted data from located articles in a pre-defined structured way, and assessed likelihood of causality in each individual case. DATA SYNTHESIS: 89 articles which reported 124 cases were located. The most frequent adverse events were: pneumothorax (25 cases), spinal cord injury (18 cases), acute hepatitis B (11 cases), and localized argyria (10 cases). There were two fatalities from infections. Forty-eight events were caused by needle breakage including 26 cases of intentionally embedded needle and 16 cases of accidental breakage. There were also 10 cases of injury from self-treatment. CONCLUSION: Although it has already been demonstrated that severe adverse events seem to be uncommon in standard practice, many serious cases of negligence have been found in the present review, suggesting that training system for acupuncturists (including medical doctors) should be improved and that unsupervised self-treatment should be discouraged.},

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A search for prospective surveys of the safety of acupuncture was conducted using computerized databases (Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and CISCOM), inquiries to acupuncture organizations, and our own files. Data on sample, size, types of patients duration of study, types of acupuncture, definition of adverse events, method of evaluation, and findings were extracted systematically from the retrieved reports. RESULTS: Nine surveys were located and included in the review. Their results were not uniform. The most common adverse events were needle pain (1% to 45%) from treatments, tiredness (2% to 41%), and bleeding (0.03% to 38%). Feelings of faintness and syncope were uncommon, with an incidence of 0% to 0.3%. Feelings of relaxation were reported by as many as 86% of patients. Pneumothorax was rare, occurring only twice in nearly a quarter of a million treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Although the incidence of minor adverse events associated with acupuncture may be considerable, serious adverse events are rare. Those responsible for establishing competence in acupuncture should consider how to reduce these risks.},

SUBJECTS: All patients who underwent acupuncture treatment during a period of 4 months from April to July 1998. OUTCOME MEASURES: Type, severity, and incidence of acupuncture adverse reactions. RESULTS: A total of 391 patients were treated in 1,441 sessions, involving a total of 30,338 needle insertions. The incidence of recorded systemic reactions in individual patients was: tiredness (8.2%); drowsiness (2.8%); aggravation of preexisting symptoms (2.8%); itching in the punctured regions (1.0%); dizziness or vertigo (0.8%); feeling of faintness or nausea during treatment (0.8%); headache (0.5%); and chest pain (0.3%). The incidence of recorded local reactions, expressed as a percentage of needle insertions, was: minor bleeding on withdrawal of the needle (2.6%); pain on insertion of the needle (0.7%); petechia or ecchymosis (0.3%); pain or ache in the punctured region after the treatment (0.1%); subcutaneous haematoma (0.1%); and pain or discomfort in the punctured region during the needle retention (0.03%). CONCLUSION: Although some adverse reactions associated with acupuncture were common even in standard practice, they were transient and mild compared to cases such as pneumothorax, cardiac injury, infection, or spinal lesions reported in other studies.},

METHODS: Literature search accompanied by postmortem anatomical studies. RESULTS: Traumatic lesions after acupuncture have been described in thoracic and abdominal viscera, in the peripheral and central nervous systems, and in blood vessels. Deaths have been recorded from pneumothorax and cardiac tamponade. The anatomical structure of the body at several acupuncture points is such that needles can reach vulnerable structures. CONCLUSION: While the frequency of adverse effects of acupuncture is unknown and they may be rare, knowledge of normal anatomy and anatomical variations is essential for safe practice and should be reviewed by regulatory bodies and those responsible for training courses.},

  abstract           = {OBJECTIVES: Many of the frequently reported adverse effects of acupuncture are serious or severe such as pneumothorax, infection, spinal cord injury, or cardiac injury. However, reviewing published case reports does not provide enough information to assess the safety of acupuncture and moxibustion. In order to investigate adverse events of acupuncture, we reviewed all the relevant cases reported by the therapists at our clinic. SETTING: Over a 6 year period, in the national Tsukuba College of Technology Clinic in Japan, all the acupuncture and moxibustion therapists were required to report the cases of adverse events immediately upon recognition. RESULTS: A total of 84 therapists (13 preceptors and 71 interns) participated in the treatments. The total number of treatments was 65,482. Ninety four (0.14%) adverse events were reported. There were fourteen categories: failure to remove needles (27 cases), ecchymosis or hematoma without pain (9 cases), ecchymosis or hematoma accompanied by pain (8 cases), burn injury (7 cases), discomfort (7 cases), dizziness (6 cases), nausea or vomiting (6 cases), pain in the punctured region (6 cases), minor hemorrhage (4 cases), aggravation of complaint (4 cases), malaise (3 cases), suspected contact dermatitis (3 cases), fever (3 cases) and numbness in the upper extremities (1 case). CONCLUSION: No serious or severe cases such as pneumothorax, infection, or spinal cord injury were reported by the college preceptors and interns. The results indicate that serious or severe adverse events are rare in standard practice. We suggest that most severe or serious cases of adverse events caused by acupuncture reported in journals are actually cases of negligence. In the future, negligence should be discussed from the point of view of medical education and technical instruction for the therapists, and adverse reactions should be discussed from the point of view of incidence and prevention based on the result of further investigation.},

A total of 193 patients were reported with adverse effects of acupuncture in 14 years. Pneumothorax is the most common mechanical organ injury, while hepatitis dominates among infections. Acupuncture treatment is claimed to be responsible in the death of three patients. One patient died from bilateral pneumothorax, another got endocarditis, and died of complications. The third patient died of severe asthma while under acupuncture treatment. Most adverse effects of acupuncture seem to rely on insufficient basic medical knowledge, low hygienic standard, and inadequate acupuncture education. The study confirms the adverse effects of acupuncture under certain circumstances. Serious adverse effects, however, are few, and acupuncture can generally be considered as a safe treatment.},

  abstract           = {The use of acupuncture is widespread. The procedure is often claimed to be totally, or at least reasonably, safe. The published evidence regarding its potential risks is reviewed. The repeated and/or inappropriate use of an acupuncture needle carries the risk of infections. Amongst others, AIDS and hepatitis have been transmitted. Acupuncture needles may also traumatise tissues and organs. Pneumothorax is the most frequent complication caused in this way. Finally, needles may break and fragments can be dislodged into distant organs. A serious and more general concern related to the safety of acupuncture is the competence of the therapist, whether or not medically qualified. The "philosophy" of acupuncture is not in line with orthodox diagnostic skills; therefore acupuncturists can be dangerously unconcerned with diagnostic categories. Thus indirect risks might add significantly to the direct risks of acupuncture. It is concluded that the true risk of acupuncture cannot be estimated. Whatever its extent, it could and probably should be lowered by enforcing educational and clinical standards.},

Pneumothorax is the most common mechanical organ injury caused, while hepatitis dominates the infections. Neither pneumothorax nor hepatitis is reported from any Nordic country. Most of the adverse effects of acupuncture seem to be associated with insufficient basic medical knowledge, a low standard of hygiene and inadequate education in acupuncture. The study confirms adverse effects of acupuncture in certain circumstances. Serious adverse effects are few, and acupuncture can be considered as a fairly harmless form of treatment.},

  abstract           = {Knowledges of acupuncture has played a major role in the treatment of human diseases, and has been mentioned in ancient Chinese medical literature for thousands of years. The loci which are most commonly used as treatment sites are points on the Ren Channel, kidney Channel, Stomach Channel, Pericardium Channel, Lung Channel, Spleen Channel and Gallbladder Channel for those loci on the human chest, insertion depth beyond safety level, can create serious consequences other such as pneumothorax, internal organ bleeding or other damage. This study was designed to determine the real safety depth for each locus by using a current scientific approach. The study was carried out at Tri-Service General Hospital and Mackay General Hospital. The sample patient population was 120. According to their body weight and height, patients were divided into six groups with various body sizes, i.e. normal, over and under-weight adults, and by sex differences. After computer tomographic scanning chest, the relative acupuncture loci should be measured according to anatomical position, then the distance between surface of the chest and thoracic pleura can be defined as its safety depth. For each locus of the groups, the mean and its interval of confident can be found. The analysis of variance (ANOVA), t-test, and multiple regression were also calculated by computer. The results show that there are significant differences in body chest loci within the same sex but, for different body sizes, statistically significant differences for each locus appear, so the safety depth for each chest locus has actually been proved. Not only does his data provide useful information for clinical practices, but also the standard safety depth for each loci on the chest could this be established.},

According to their body weight and height, they were divided into six groups with various sizes, i.e. normal, over and under-weighted adults, followed by sex differences. After computer tomographic scanning results from patients' body back, the relative acupuncture loci should be measured through their anatomical position, then the distance between surface of body back and thoracic pleura could be defined as its safety depth. For each locus of the groups, the mean and its confident interval could be found. The analysis of variance (ANOVA), t-test, and multiple regression were also calculated by means of computer. The results showed that there were no significant differences on body back loci within sex differences, but for different body sizes, there appeared statistically significant differences for each locus, (P less than 0.01), so the safety depth for each back locus have actually been proved. Not only these data provided more useful information for clinical practices, but also our standard safety depth for each loci on back can then be established.},

However, rare cases of bilateral pneumothorax have been reported since 1978, as well as a pneumothorax developing in asthmatic patients, with often dramatic consequences. A 15-year-old girl with a severe attack of asthma was treated by implantation of needles, and this coincided with the onset of a pneumothorax, and a subsequent state of status asthmaticus. A fatal outcome was only just avoided. The question is raised as to the technical quality of the implantations practised, as well as the validity and dangers of acupuncture in asthmatics, particularly during the acute attack.},

For this reason the case is presented of a 63-year-old woman, suffering from asthma, who died as a result of a bilateral pneumothorax following injury to the lungs in the course of acupuncture of the chest wall.},

  abstract  = {To the Editor.—  We have recently seen a most unusual complication of acupuncture.A 73-year-old man with severe emphysema was talked into having an acupuncture treatment for his emphysema. Immediately after the acupuncture needles were removed, he began to complain of increasing shortness of breath. Within several hours, he was brought to the emergency room where a pneumothorax was found. On closer questioning, it was determined that an acupuncture needle had been inserted into the anterior chest just below the clavicle, probably in the second anterior rib space. Because of this man's severe disease and the typical muscle-wasting that accompanies it, it is easy to postulate that the acupuncture needle, in fact, penetrated the parietal and then the visceral pleura, causing the pneumothorax.The man was treated appropriately and his pneumothorax responded to closed-chest thoracotomy. The patient's reserve was minimal, however, and after six days in the hospital, his condition...

  abstract               = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the reporting characteristics of case reports of acupuncture therapy with CAse Report (CARE) guidelines, and to explore the applicability of the guidelines for these case reports. METHODS: Case reports published from January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2013, were identified by searching PubMed and the China Biomedicine Database by using MeSH terms. Screening and data extraction of case reports were conducted by two independent researchers. Assessments based on CARE guidelines and data analysis were conducted by using Excel 2003 and RevMan 5.0. RESULTS: A total of 61 case reports published in 19 journals were identified, which involved 16 major types of diseases. Fifteen (24.6%) case reports declared no conflict of interests, and 5 (8.2%) reported funding sources. None of these case reports met all items of CARE guidelines, and only 6 subordinate items were fully reported among 50% of the case reports. Subgroup analysis indicated that case reports published in English or those that did not have competing interests had higher reporting quality. CONCLUSIONS: The reporting quality of case reports of acupuncture therapy is rather low. The reason might be a lack of awareness among authors and the poor dissemination of information regarding CARE guidelines in China. More evaluation studies are needed to promote and improve adherence to CARE guidelines. Moreover, an extended version of CARE guidelines should be developed for cases reports of special interventions such as acupuncture or adverse events caused by interventions.},

   Frequent side effects of acupuncture are local pain, autonomic nervous
   system reactions (including fainting) and small local bleeding or
   hematomas. There are, however, some case reports of serious adverse
   reactions. Since 1980, there have been 18 pneumothoraces post
   acupuncture therapy reported in the literature. Hepatitis due to
   inadequate hygiene standards has also been reported. Some patients with
   valvular heart disease have developed endocarditis after acupuncture.
   Ear acupuncture with permanent needles can cause chondritis or
   perichondritis.
   For any acupuncture treatment, a careful case history and exact
   diagnosis are necessary. In particular, it should be determined whether
   wound-healing disorders, immunosuppression, coagulation defects,
   valvular heart disease or pregnancy are present, as all of these
   constitute relative contraindications to acupuncture. Hygiene standards
   have to be observed. Bearing these points in mind, acupuncture is a

Harmless disturbances are common and include minor bleedings or haematomas, pain during insertion or after withdrawal of the needle, and skin symptoms. in every second acupuncture treatment, at least one of these complications occurs. Orthostatic dysregulations are relatively rare and can be observed in only 1% of patients. They can be prevented by treating the patient in a lying position, especially in the first treatment session. Stab injuries of internal organs most often affect the lungs, resulting in a pneumothorax. At least 23 cases have been published, 2 of them with fatal consequences. An inquiry of Norwegian doctors even suggests that until 1995 in Norway alone 250 cases of pneumothorax after acupuncture occurred. Stab injuries of other internal organs or the CNS are only described in case reports, but some of them had fatal consequences. Stab injuries of peripheral nerves or large vessels and systemic bacterial infections like sepsis or endocarditis are very rare but serious consequences have been described. The transmission of viral infections due to insufficiently sterilised acupuncture needles loses more and more importance. The incidence of local infections can possibly be influenced, but even in Europe this complication still occurs frequently, The overview of published complications leads to the contraindications of acupuncture. Disturbances of coagulation, immune deficiency, abnormal heart valves or prosthetic valves are the most important ones to name. Suggestions for obtaining informed consent may be helpful while performing clinical trials.},

Several hundred reports have been published of life-threatening adverse events after acupuncture. The aim of our study was to assess the adverse effects of acupuncture during a normal treatment routine. Methods: Thirteen general practitioners and outpatient clinics and 16 other practitioners were included in a questionnaire survey in Germany. Patient gender and age, indications for and method of treatment, and adverse effects were documented by the therapists. Results: Four hundred and nine patients receiving 3535 acupuncture treatment were included. Adverse effects were observed in 402 treatments (11.4%) in 153 different patients. The main side effects were slight haemorrhage (2.9%), haematoma (2.2%), dizziness (1%) and other systemic symptoms (2.7%). Other side effects mentioned (all below 1%) were fainting, nausea, prolonged DeQi effect (paraesthesia) and increase of pain. In one case, aphasia was reported lasting 1 h after acupuncture. Conclusion: Acupuncture has adverse effects, like any therapeutic approach. If it is used according to established safety rules and carefully at appropriate anatomic regions, it is a safe treatment method. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},
